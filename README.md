# Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal learning journey in Machine Learning, mainly focused on Supervised Learning algorithms. I use this space to practice different models, understand their concepts, and visualize results using Python.

## What I Am Learning
I am currently studying and implementing the following algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier


More supervised and unsupervised algorithms will be added as I continue learning.

## Notebooks
All implementations are in Jupyter Notebooks.  
Each notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and testing
- Evaluation metrics
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Short explanations for better understanding

## Goals of This Repository
- Build a strong foundation in Machine Learning
- Practice key algorithms with clear understanding
- Improve Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib skills
- Keep clean and organized notebooks for revision

## Future Plans
- Add more supervised learning algorithms
- Start unsupervised learning (K-Means, PCA, etc.)
- Perform deeper analysis and feature engineering
- Work on small ML projects

This repository is mainly for my learning and practice.
